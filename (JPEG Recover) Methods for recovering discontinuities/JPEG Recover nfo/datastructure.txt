===========

SOI
Tables/Misc.- DHT/DQT/DAC/DRI/APP_n/COM segments
DHP Segment (Optional- only for hierarchical - shall precede the first frame; only one DHP segment shall occur in the compressed image data)
	     DHP segment structure is identical to the frame header syntax, except that the DHP marker is used instead of the SOF_n marker
	     figures and descriptions of B.2.2. apply, except that the quantization table destination selecto paramter is set to zero in the DHP segment
EXP Segment (Expand reference components marker - precedes any differential SOF requiring resolution changes in the reference component)
	     (applies only to the next frame which must be a differential frame). May be one ofthe table-specifications/miscellaneous marker segments
	      preceding the frame header. SHALL NOT BE one of the table-specification/miscellaneous segments preceding a scan header or a DHP marker segment)
Frame (or multiple frames in hierarchical)DQT
EOI - always signals end of compressed image data (after all available frames never any place else)


Note for Hierarchical: First frame for each COMPONENT in the hierarchy shall be encoded by a non-differential frame

Frame
=====

A frame header may be preceded by one or more table-specifications or miscellaneous marker segments. If a DNL segment
is present, it shall immediately follow the first scan. For SEQUENTIAL DCT-based and lossless processes, each scan shall
be interleaved within the scan. For progressive DCT-based processes each image component is only partially contained within
any one scan. ONLY the first scan(s) for the COMPONENTS may be interleaved.

Scan - scan segment
Frame Header - SOF marker + data
DNL Segment - DNL segment - Marks a DNL segment. Only occurs within the frame segment at the end of the FIRST scan
Tables/Misc. - DHT/DQT/DAC/DRI/APP_n/COM segments

Illustration:



[ *Tables/Misc. | Frame Header | Scan | *DNL Segment | *Scan_2 | ... | *Scan LAST]


Scan
====

A scan shall begin with a scan header and shall contain one or more entropy-coded data segments. Each scan
header may be precededed by ONE OR MORE table-spec/misc marker segments. If restart is NOT enabled, there shall
be only ONE entropy-coded segment (the one labeled last) and no restart markers shall be present. If restart is enabled,
the number of entropy-coded segments is defined by the size of the iamge and the defined restart interval. In this case,
a restart marker shall follow each entropy-coded segment EXCEPT the last one.


RST_m: a conditional marker placed between entropy coded segments (ONLY IF RESTART IS ENABLED) There
       are 8 unique restart markers (m = 0-7) which repeat in sequence from 0 to 7, starting with zero
       for each scan, providing a modulo 8 restart interval count

Scan Header - SOS marker plus data
ECS - ECS segment
RST - restart marker
Tables/Misc. - DHT/DQT/DAC/DRI/APP_n/COM segments

[ *Tables/Misc | Scan Header | ECS | RST_0 | ... | ECS_LAST-1 | RST_LAST-1 | ECS_LAST ]


Entropy-coded segment (ECS)
======================

If restart is enabled and the restart interval is defined to be Ri, each entropy coded segment except the last
one shall contain Ri MCUs. The last one shall contain whatever number of MCUs completes the scan
