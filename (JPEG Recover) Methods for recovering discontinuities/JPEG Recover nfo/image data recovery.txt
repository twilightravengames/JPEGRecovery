idea for recovery of image data:

Given an image defined by the matrix V where vsubi,subj = (a,b,c) = the vector usubi,subj

and vsubi,subj is a pixel


then approximation functions Osubmu(i,j,a,b,c) may be generated from the vectors given by usubi,subj through a newton apprximation
newton series approximation and an overall approximation function O(i,j,a,b,c) may be generated through an
interpolation process of the prior mentioned Osubmu()

Lost or corrupt data can be removed prior to the generation of this function, and missing or corrupt data
can be considered a discontinuity in this function. Then, these discontinuities can be recovered using
the function continuity recovery procedure mentioned in another document.
